My Awesome Portfolio

---

This web application acts as my portfolio. On it I have all of my projects posted, an about me page, links to my socials, and a contact me form. 

Link to project: https://shayafra.netlify.app

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My portfolio is structured so that I can continually add more projects to it and it wouldn't break the page. This website is front-end so its just html, css, and javascript. The form at the end of the page is linked so that messages are sent directly to my email.
